# ðŸ§® Calculate Discount (Python)

This is a simple Python program that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. The discount is only applied if the discount percentage is **20% or higher**. Otherwise, the original price is returned.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Takes user input for:
  - Original item price
  - Discount percentage
- Applies discount **only if it's 20% or more**
- Handles invalid input (e.g., non-numeric values)
- Prints final price with proper formatting

## ðŸ§  Logic

The program uses a function `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` to determine if a discount should be applied. If the discount is valid (â‰¥ 20%), it calculates the reduced price; otherwise, it returns the original price.
